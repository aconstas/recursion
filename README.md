# recursion
Reviewing recursion with The Odin Project.

***Recursion exercises taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)***

1. *Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].*

2. *Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively*
